# Trial Pipeline Signup Visualiser

The internal monitor we display at [Buildkite](https://buildkite.com/) HQ to monitor new customers signing up, how theyâ€™re progressing, and who ultimately upgrades.

To start it up locally (in a webpack dev server):

```bash
yarn && yarn start
```

This will use data from [accounts.json](accounts.json). If you want to point it to a server-based JSON endpoint (using the webpack dev server http proxy), set the following environment variables:

```bash
env TRIAL_DASHBOARD_ENDPOINT='http://myserver.com/endpoint' TRIAL_DASHBOARD_SECRET='xyz' yarn start
```

## Setup as a system service

```
git clone ... /usr/local/trial-pipeline-visualizer
cp com.buildkite.trial-vis.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.buildkite.trial-vis.plist
```

Add `kiosk.command` as a login item, and set the user to auto-login.
